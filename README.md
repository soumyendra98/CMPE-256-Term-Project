### RecipeWiz
“RecipeWiz” is an engine that can help users find a subset of recipes available on Food.com. However, it is just not a recipe collection but offers a range of recommendations based on several search criteria pertaining to recipes as well as factors like user ratings and reviews. 

Our goal is to offer users with a wide range of options based on different criteria like similar ingredients, similar nutritional value, similar method of preparation, etc., by leveraging the powerful techniques of item-item collaborative filtering. When a user searches for a recipe, multiple carousels with recommended recipes will be displayed where each carousel shows recipes similar to the searched one. Clicking on a recipe will show all the details of that recipe like ingredients, preparation steps, nutritional information, etc.
